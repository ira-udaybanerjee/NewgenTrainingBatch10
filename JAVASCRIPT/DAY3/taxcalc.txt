arv = coveredarea * 0.80 * 0.25 * 12 * 1

third value depends on road width selected:

<12m = 0.25
12-24 = 0.40
>24 = 0.50

last value depends on:

Resi = 1
NR = 5


Once this is done add another button to calculate tax:

if waterline selected then (arv*0.4) + (arv*0.3)

if sewer selected then (arv*0.4) + (arv*0.3) + (arv*0.15)
